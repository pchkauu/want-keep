# Task-2.9 — explicit debts and household reimbursements

Implemented the backend/API for explicit debts between household members. Original base: `a4a77365b909080b48093bc5304216489526642c`; branch: `feat/task-2.9-family-reimbursements`. Task-2.4 and task-2.8 are included. No new libraries; migrations 001–018 and production remain unchanged.

Ledger stores creditor and debtor as distinct active `MembershipID` values together with exact native principal, outstanding amount, state, actor and immutable revisions. Debt appears only after an explicit command. Expense allocation, payer and an ordinary transfer never create it. An optional expense link captures its current posted revision without deriving debt principal. `open|settled|attention_required|voided` are excluded from household assets, balances, income and expenses.

Settlement uses an existing posted transfer from a debtor-owned personal account to a creditor-owned personal account. Fees are excluded from available principal. A stable transaction/matching key accounts for one monetary carrier independently from the selected side of a proven group. One transfer may settle several debts only within its unused received principal. Same-asset settlement requires equal `transferAmount` and `settledAmount`; cross-asset settlement supplies both amounts explicitly without an inferred rate or parity.

A financial edit, exclusion, cancellation or reversal of the linked transfer makes an active settlement `stale` and restores outstanding debt. A non-financial edit preserves the link. A source-expense change makes the debt `attention_required`. Corrections cannot change parties or asset while active settlements exist and cannot reduce principal below the settled amount. Selective undo preserves independent later decisions and detects overlapping field provenance, including A–B–A; settlement undo restores debt.

Migration `019_family_reimbursements.sql` adds current records, immutable revisions, field versions, decisions, settlements, transfer usage, operation links and audit. Compound household foreign keys, exact `NUMERIC`, immutable triggers and least-privilege grants retain isolation. Command `pending` is durable first; reimbursement revision, settlement, audit, outbox and terminal result commit atomically under the household lock. Command result access also rechecks current authorization to the debt.

OpenAPI implements `GET/POST /reimbursements`, detail/history reads, corrections, settlements and selective undo. Mutations use the session actor, Origin/CSRF, `Idempotency-Key`, `expectedRevision`, command recovery and `no-store`. List/history use session-bound keyset cursors with a default page size of 50 and maximum 100. Foreign and missing debts are indistinguishable.

## Verification and boundaries

Required verification: `make check`, `make test-integration AREA=all`, `make test-family-reimbursements-race`, affected race suites, privacy suite and `git diff --check`. PostgreSQL 17.11 is digest-pinned; missing DB fails the integration suite. Family-reimbursements integration/race run in CI.

The suite checks exact RUB, USD, USDT, USDC, BTC and ETH; RUB 300 settled as 100+200; one transfer across several debts; over-settlement rejection; cross-asset settlement with two amounts; no income/expense from transfer principal; replay; concurrent settlements; correction/undo and A–B–A. It also verifies debt restoration after a financial transfer edit, preservation after a text edit, `attention_required` after an expense change, household isolation, command visibility, CSRF, pagination, migration, immutable history and grants for the unprivileged role.

Backend portions of AC-006, AC-082 and AC-086 are proven. SCR-013 UI, cash reimbursement without an existing ledger transfer, live banking, browser acceptance and production acceptance remain with downstream tasks. SDD remains **Ready for development**.
