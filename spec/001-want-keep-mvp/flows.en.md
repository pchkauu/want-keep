## Import and AI review

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  P[Platform] --> G[API gateway / Playwright]
  G --> R[SourceRecord and coverage]
  R --> M[Mapping and domain validation]
  M --> L[Atomic ledger + outbox]
  L --> A[Revision-specific AI review]
  A --> V[Authorized command validation]
  V --> C[Category / substantiated link]
  V --> Q[Clarification]
  C --> D[Projections and dashboard]
  L --> D
  P --> S[BalanceSnapshot]
  S --> X[Reconciliation]
  L --> X
```

Retain SourceRecord even with incomplete mapping. Ledger operations can continue while AI waits; unknown financial values do not post. The dashboard separately shows source freshness, coverage and AI-review status.

## Receipt and late import

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  actor O as Member
  participant W as Web chat
  participant A as Application
  participant AI as OpenAI
  participant L as Ledger
  O->>W: Select account and send receipt
  W->>A: Message + attachmentId + accountId + idempotency
  A->>A: Authorize and validate file
  A->>AI: Authorized data without secrets
  AI-->>A: Structured proposal
  alt Exact data is missing
    A-->>W: Clarify specific fields
  else Document is irrelevant
    A-->>W: Explicit skip and reason
  else Data is established
    A->>L: Create or link transaction, expectedRevision
    A-->>W: Outcome and transaction link
  end
  A->>L: Late bank import
  L->>L: Exact idempotency + economic match validation
  L-->>W: One transaction, multiple evidence records
```

Equal amounts/times yield candidates, not uniqueness proof. Multiple purchases require clarification. A transaction change while AI responds makes the old proposal inapplicable.

## Plan and daily allowance

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  F[Confirmed funds by currency] --> K[Available limit]
  R[Unique goal reservations] --> K
  O[Outstanding obligations] --> K
  B[Remaining flexible budget] --> K
  E[Expected income dates] --> Q[Daily forecast and cash shortfalls]
  F --> Q
  R --> Q
  O --> Q
  B --> Q
  AI[AI proposal] --> U[Authorized member decision]
  U --> B
```

Received income changes actuals; a planned date does not create money. A fulfilled payment releases the corresponding reserved obligation.

## Mac backups

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant M as MacBook
  participant S as Application VPS
  participant P as Managed PostgreSQL
  participant F as Immutable attachments
  participant B as Local backup
  M->>S: Authorized hourly pull while reachable
  S->>P: Logical dump over private VPC
  S->>F: Inventory at consistent cutoff
  P-->>S: DB stream
  F-->>S: Attachments + manifest
  S-->>M: Restricted export stream
  M->>M: Verify parts and checksums
  M->>B: Atomically complete encrypted set
  M->>S: Acknowledge verified manifest
  Note over M,P: Unreachable Mac increases the age of the last complete copy
```

A partial set never replaces the last complete backup. Recovery keys must remain available outside the sole failed system. Retention is 48 hourly, 30 daily, 8 weekly and 12 monthly points within a 20 GiB cap; never delete the last complete set. The one-hour RPO depends on Mac availability and set verification. Restoring an old set into clean managed PostgreSQL does not automatically activate old bank sessions. Full contract and open runtime gates: [hosting evidence](evidence/hosting.en.md).

## Household permissions and views

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  U[Separate user session] --> M[Membership and household scope]
  M --> C[Command and current permissions]
  C --> L[Ledger: amount and actor]
  L --> A[Member and category allocations]
  A --> F[One household actual]
  A --> P[Individual views]
  F --> K[Household K per currency]
  K --> D[One allowance matrix]
  D --> P
```

## Task-2.4: from facts to one effect

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Manual entry / trusted normalization] --> B[Household transaction and current rights]
  I[CommitPage: admission / generation / lease] --> B
  B --> C[D-39 idempotency]
  C --> D{Proven correspondence?}
  D -->|Yes| E[Validate composition and field protections]
  D -->|Probable candidate only| F[Retain waiting and evidence without a second effect]
  F --> G[Member: link or separate with revisions]
  G --> E
  E --> H[Decision + journal revisions + projections + review/outbox]
  H --> J[Command outcome / checkpoint]
  H --> K[History and compound undo]
```

Original statuses and dates remain in history. Incomplete search and waiting produce matching_unresolved; source observations stay separate. Stale import jobs enter quarantine before this flow. Bank IO and document recognition are connected by their owning tasks.

## Task-3.2: connector ingestion page

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant J as Validated sync job
  participant C as API/Browser collector
  participant E as EvidenceStore
  participant G as Admission gate
  participant A as Accounts/Ledger
  participant Q as Quarantine
  participant R as Restart reconciler
  J->>G: Verify exact gateway binding
  J->>G: BeforeRead(binding, revision, generation, lease)
  G->>C: Server-issued request without household/actor/internal IDs
  C-->>G: Exact echo + issued cursor + evidence + typed records/coverage
  G->>E: Persist raw evidence with server-derived household/job and disposition=staged
  alt provider failure
    G->>Q: Associate evidence with household/job
    G->>G: Atomically retain waiting/retry/failed
  else binding/revision/generation/lease/cursor are current
    G->>A: CommitPage: resolve accounts + source revisions + observations/postings
    A-->>G: Audit/outbox/checkpoint + immutable receipt atomically
    opt Commit acknowledgement is lost
      G->>G: Read receipt; leave staged without proof
    end
    opt account/source ambiguity
      A->>Q: Evidence + source_ambiguous/transaction_unresolved
      A-->>G: Partial coverage without an unconfirmed effect
    end
  else page is rejected after staging
    G->>Q: Durable retention in a separate lifecycle context
    Q-->>G: Only success moves staged to rejected_result
  else result is stale
    G->>Q: Evidence reference + safe reason
  end
  opt Disposition remains staged after restart
    R->>E: Read staged batches
    R->>G: Find terminal receipt by household/job/evidence
    G-->>R: page/provider_outcome/rejected_result/stale_result or unknown
    R->>E: Idempotently finalize only a proven disposition
  end
```

A page is self-contained: every supported account used by a balance or posting has an account descriptor on that page. A later page repeats the descriptor and prior cursor; replay creates no account/opening/financial effect. `nextCursor` is either absent or non-empty. A provider failure also echoes the issued cursor; the sync-result boundary rejects a delayed outcome from an earlier page, while the shared lease identity keeps heartbeat valid after checkpoint advancement. Failure on page two never advances its cursor, while the confirmed first page stays committed with partial coverage. The cumulative gap set after merging the checkpoint is capped at 100 values; overflow rolls the page back. An ambiguous account or source cannot turn the page into a complete success and does not discard independent supported records. A confirmed `RUR → RUB` provider mapping preserves the raw code in evidence/metadata and uses RUB in the financial domain. A replay with a new evidence ID/locator, equivalent empty optional fields and the same normalized payload/raw digest creates no source revision. Evidence uses canonical base64 without CR/LF. Only the atomic receipt proves an unknown commit outcome; without it evidence remains staged. The restart reconciler finalizes disposition only from a stored terminal receipt and never replays the financial effect.

## Task-3.3: browser job

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant W as Go worker
  participant V as Credentials vault
  participant C as Collector over Unix socket
  participant P as Synthetic/provider portal
  participant E as Encrypted evidence
  participant G as Admission commit fence
  W->>W: Validate stored job binding/revision/generation/lease
  W->>V: Borrow browser_session
  V-->>W: Plaintext only in job memory
  W->>C: Capabilities(exact binding/revision)
  W->>W: Persist external_started
  W->>C: Read(server-issued request, ephemeral storageState)
  C->>C: New BrowserContext + build-owned allowlist
  C->>P: Exact read or statement POST only
  P-->>C: Typed page or reauth/MFA/CAPTCHA
  C-->>W: Exact SyncResult without session
  W->>E: Encrypt raw evidence with household/job/page/item AAD
  W->>G: CommitPage or CommitFailure
  alt binding/revision/generation/lease is current
    G-->>W: Receipt and terminal disposition
  else result is stale
    G-->>W: Quarantine without checkpoint or financial effect
  else connection is lost after external_started
    W-->>W: unresolved without automatic provider replay
  end
  W->>V: Clear borrowed session
  C->>C: Close BrowserContext
```

The collector receives no actor, household permission, arbitrary route or browser script. Task-4.x adds user portal sign-in and provider-specific workflows. Task-8.x proves production egress and runtime admission.
